# Simple Router

This package is a simple PSR-4 router for PHP.



## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require alkimisti/simplerouter:dev-main
```

## Usage

``` php
$router = new Router();
$router->resolve();
```

The first URL segment will be used as the name of the controller; `/home` will instantiate `App\Controllers\HomeController.php`.

The second URL segment will be used as the name of the action/method; `/home/index` will invoke `index()` method in `App\Controllers\HomeController`.

Other segments will be forwarded as method arguments; `/products/show/5` will invoke `show()` method in `App\Controllers\ProductsController`, passing the number `5` as its first argument.
